Advanced Visual Basic Chess follows the typical rules of the classic board game. 
The goal is to capture the King piece of the opposing team. Each team is given the 
same set of beginning pieces, each type having its own set of rules regarding 
movement. A more complete summary of the rules for Chess can be found at this URL 
(https://www.chess.com/learn-how-to-play-chess).
  The application itself organizes the pieces, squares, and game board in discrete 
data types that often utilize each other. The Piece class is the base class used for 
all pieces with each type having a subclass (Pawn, Bishop, Knight, Rook, Queen, and 
King). Each piece contains some information about the piece like its movement 
abilities, position on the board, and color. A class for each square on the board 
was created to simplify the communication of information about each item on the grid. 
Many of the possible moves for each piece are stored in an array of linked lists of 
Squares, each element containing a list of each progressive move that could be made 
on a given path.
